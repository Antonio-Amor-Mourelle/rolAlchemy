# rolAlchemy
In this repository is the rol alchemy app


To use it you must open a postgreSQL db call rol-alchemy first

After that, you can run populate.py if you want to have a pretty little db created.

Otherwise, you can just execute main.py and start playing

Note: use always python3 to run the diferent scripts
